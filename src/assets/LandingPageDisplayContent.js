        Sustainability is a societal goal that broadly aims for humans to safely
        co-exist on Earth over a long time. Specific definitions of
        sustainability are difficult to agree on and therefore vary in the
        literature and over time. Socially responsible investing, social
        investment, sustainable socially conscious, "green" or ethical
        investing, is any investment strategy which seeks to consider both
        financial return and social/environmental good to bring about social
        change regarded as positive by proponents.
